defmodule ExMachine.ServerMachine do
  @moduledoc """
  GenServer-based statechart execution server.

  This module provides a GenServer wrapper around ExMachine statecharts,
  allowing statecharts to run as supervised processes that can handle
  events asynchronously and maintain their state across multiple interactions.

  ## Features

  * **Supervised Process**: Runs as a GenServer that can be supervised
  * **Asynchronous Event Processing**: Handle events without blocking callers
  * **State Persistence**: Maintains statechart state across events
  * **Event Queuing**: Built-in event queue for handling concurrent events
  * **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and monitoring capabilities
  * **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic restart and recovery through supervisor trees

  ## Usage

  To use ExMachine.ServerMachine, you typically create a module that defines
  your statechart and then start it as a GenServer:

      defmodule MyStatechartServer do
        use ExMachine.ServerMachine

        # Define your statechart
        def init_statechart() do
          %{
            initial: "idle",
            states: %{
              "idle" => %{
                transitions: %{
                  "start" => "working"
                }
              },
              "working" => %{
                transitions: %{
                  "complete" => "idle",
                  "error" => "error"
                }
              },
              "error" => %{
                transitions: %{
                  "reset" => "idle"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        end

        # Optional: customize initial context
        def init_context() do
          %{
            start_time: System.system_time(:second),
            error_count: 0
          }
        end
      end

      # Start the server
      {:ok, pid} = MyStatechartServer.start_link(name: :my_statechart)

      # Send events
      MyStatechartServer.send_event(pid, :start)
      MyStatechartServer.send_event(pid, {:complete, %{result: "success"}})

      # Get current state
      current_state = MyStatechartServer.get_state(pid)

  ## Supervision

  ExMachine.ServerMachine processes can be easily supervised:

      defmodule MyApp.Supervisor do
        use Supervisor

        def start_link(init_arg) do
          Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, init_arg, name: __MODULE__)
        end

        def init(_init_arg) do
          children = [
            {MyStatechartServer, name: :my_statechart}
          ]

          Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
        end
      end

  ## Advanced Features

  ### Custom Event Handling

      defmodule AdvancedStatechartServer do
        use ExMachine.ServerMachine

        # Override handle_event for custom processing
        def handle_event(event, state) do
          # Custom preprocessing
          event = preprocess_event(event)
          
          # Call default handler
          result = super(event, state)
          
          # Custom postprocessing
          postprocess_result(result)
        end
      end

  ### State Change Callbacks

      defmodule CallbackStatechartServer do
        use ExMachine.ServerMachine

        # Called whenever state changes
        def on_state_change(old_config, new_config, context) do
          Logger.info("State changed from \#{inspect(old_config)} to \#{inspect(new_config)}")
        end

        # Called on macrostep completion
        def on_macrostep_complete(completed_macrostep) do
          Metrics.increment("statechart.macrosteps")
          Metrics.histogram("statechart.transition_count", length(completed_macrostep.transitions))
        end
      end

  ## Error Handling

  The ServerMachine includes built-in error handling for common scenarios:

  * **Invalid Events**: Events that don't trigger any transitions are ignored
  * **Action Failures**: Failed actions are logged but don't crash the server
  * **Guard Failures**: Failed guards prevent transitions but don't crash
  * **Malformed Events**: Invalid event formats are logged and ignored

  ## Performance Considerations

  * Events are processed sequentially to maintain statechart semantics
  * Large contexts should avoid deep copying by using references
  * Consider using `cast` for fire-and-forget events
  * Use `call` when you need confirmation of event processing

  ## NOTE

  This module is currently a placeholder and needs implementation.
  The documentation above represents the intended API and functionality.
